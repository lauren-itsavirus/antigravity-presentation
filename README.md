A high-fidelity, interactive presentation deck built with the bleeding edge of web technologies. This project demonstrates "Antigravity" concepts through immersive 3D scenes, glassmorphism UI, and smooth animations.

## Features

- **Interactive 3D Scenes**: Powered by React Three Fiber, featuring custom shaders, geometry, and post-processing effects.
- **High-End UI**: "Ambient High-Tech" aesthetic with glassmorphism, dynamic glowing effects, and precise typography.
- **Seamless Animations**: Complex layout transitions and element animations using Framer Motion.
- **Modern Architecture**: Built on Next.js 16 (App Router) & React 19.
